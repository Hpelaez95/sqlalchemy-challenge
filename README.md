# sqlalchemy-challenge
Added my sql alchemy code to the notebook and also added the flask code to the app.py. Tested both to make sure they work.
The flask routes for the start date and for start and stop need specific formatting to work.
the format is exact like '2016-08-23'. the min, avg, and max will show up when input correctly. 
they will need to replace the words of either start or start and end.
